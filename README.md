# ShopifyClient

ShopifyClient is intended to be a thread-safe client of the Shopify API. `shopify_api` gem is great, but due to ActiveResource dependency, it's not thread safe unfortunately.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'shopify_client'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install shopify_client
